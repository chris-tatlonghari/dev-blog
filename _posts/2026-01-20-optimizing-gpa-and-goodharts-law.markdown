I graduated with a **4.0 GPA**. For a long time, I treated that fact like a quiet credential—proof that I was disciplined, capable, and serious about my craft. It opened doors. It earned praise. And for years, I assumed it had prepared me for the real world of software engineering.

**It absolutely didn’t**.  
In subtle but important ways, it actually worked against me.

I didn’t realize this until I had been in the field long enough to notice a mismatch between how I had been trained to succeed and what real progress actually looked like.

# When Optimization Becomes the Enemy

In school, the rules are explicit. The goals are clean. You optimize for grades.

A 4.0 is the clearest possible signal: no mistakes, no ambiguity, no partial credit left on the table. Every assignment is a transaction with an authority figure. You do the work, they evaluate it, and a number appears. That number becomes the objective.

This is where I unknowingly ran into **Goodhart’s Law**:

> *When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.*

Grades are meant to *measure* understanding. But when they become the thing you optimize for, learning warps around them. You stop asking, “What will teach me the most?” and start asking, “What maximizes my score?”

I optimized well. Too well.

## Perfectionism Is Only Half the Problem

Most people talk about perfectionism as the downside of academic success. That’s real—but it’s not the most damaging effect.

The deeper issue is **mistake avoidance**.

Keeping a 4.0 trains you to avoid risk. You choose safe approaches. You double-check everything. You hesitate before committing. You internalize the idea that mistakes are costly and visible, and that the best path forward is the one with the lowest variance.

That mindset works well in school.  
It breaks down in software engineering.

There’s a half-joking, half-true heuristic in the software industry:

> *If you’re not breaking production, you’re not shipping fast enough.*

The point isn’t recklessness—it’s feedback. In life and in software: real systems are complex. You cannot reason your way to perfect solutions in advance. You learn by shipping, observing, experimenting, and iterating.

Mistake avoidance slows that feedback loop to a crawl.

## The Illusion of Authority

School quietly installs something else in your head: **a grand authority**.

There is always *someone* to please.  
A professor. A grader. A rubric. A syllabus.

Success means aligning your work with an external, centralized judgment.

In professional software engineering, that authority doesn’t exist.

There is no authoritative grader.  
No single correct solution to a real problem.  
No universal rubric.

You are judged indirectly—by system behavior, by user outcomes, and by long-term maintainability. Often, the only real feedback comes from the consequences of your own decisions.

That transition is jarring if you’ve spent years like I did optimizing for approval.

I had to unlearn the instinct to ask, *“Is this right?”* and replace it with *“Is this useful, reversible, and forward-moving?”*

## The Key Takeaway

The skills attained in earning a 4.0—discipline, persistence, attention to detail—*are* valuable. They just need to be re-aimed.

Not toward perfection.  
Toward momentum in constantly learning and improving.

This isn’t meant as a humblebrag or a dismissal of academic achievement. It’s a cautionary tale for anyone still in school who is optimizing a metric because it’s visible, measurable, and rewarded—without realizing that the metric itself may quietly be shaping the wrong instincts for the long run.

The irony is that this lesson itself follows Goodhart’s Law. Grades are a useful signal—until they become the goal. At that point, they stop measuring learning and start distorting it. The same pattern shows up everywhere in engineering: velocity metrics, uptime targets, test coverage, even “best practices.” The moment a proxy becomes the objective, it loses its ability to tell you the truth.

In the absence of a grand authority, software engineering forces a different kind of growth. You are no longer rewarded for being mistake-free—you’re rewarded for learning faster than the mistakes compound. Progress comes from judgment, iteration, and ownership, not from perfect scores. And once you internalize that shift, you stop asking how to keep your record clean and start asking a far more useful question: What will move this system forward, even if I have to be wrong first?
